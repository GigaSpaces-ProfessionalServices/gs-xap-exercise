A programming exercise for XAP

1. Fork this repo and clone locally
1. Read the [XAP in 5 minutes doc](http://docs.gigaspaces.com/xap97/your-first-data-grid-application.html) and implement it in your repo.
Note the comment about running in free mode. Only run a single partition for now...
1. Commit, push
1. Implement a client applications that writes 1024 Persons to the grid
1. Commit, push
1. Update your client application to take a single parameter from the command line (or shell script, etc) which the application parses as a floating point number in the range [0,1]. This number is the percentage of Persons that are to be written to the *first* partition.
1. Wait for Ali or me to provide you a sample license key. Once you've received it, run with *two* partitions and test your implementation
1. Commit, push
1. Create a pull request and put any extra comments about your implementation in the pull request.

Thank you!
